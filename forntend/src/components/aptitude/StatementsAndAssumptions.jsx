        <h2>What are Statements and Assumptions?</h2>
        <p>
          **Statements and Assumptions** are a critical part of logical reasoning. A statement is an assertion that conveys information, while an assumption is something taken for granted without concrete proof. In logical reasoning questions, the assumption is usually an underlying belief or premise that forms the basis of a conclusion.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          - A **statement** is an assertion or declaration, which could be true or false. 
          - An **assumption** is something that is accepted without proof and forms the basis of reasoning.
          - In logical reasoning, we often evaluate whether a given assumption is valid based on the provided statement.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Assumptions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Implicit Assumptions:</strong> These are not explicitly stated but are implied in the statement.</li>
          <li><strong>Explicit Assumptions:</strong> These are directly mentioned or suggested by the statement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Solve Statements and Assumptions Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Read the Statement Carefully:</strong> Pay close attention to the exact wording of the statement.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify the Assumptions:</strong> Think about the beliefs that underlie the statement, even if they aren't directly stated.</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate Validity:</strong> Check whether the assumption logically follows from the statement. An assumption should not contradict the statement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Statements and Assumptions</h2>

        <h3>Beginner Level</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Statement:</strong> "The train will depart at 8 AM tomorrow."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption 1:</strong> The train schedule is fixed.<br />
          <strong>Assumption 2:</strong> The train will depart at 8 AM as per the statement.
        </p>
        <p>Options: A. Assumption 1 is valid B. Assumption 2 is valid C. Both assumptions are valid D. Neither assumption is valid</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. Both assumptions are valid</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Assumption 1 is valid because the statement implies the train schedule is fixed. Assumption 2 is also valid because the statement directly mentions the departure time.</p>

        <h3>Intermediate Level</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Statement:</strong> "The company will introduce a new product next month to cater to the increasing demand in the market."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption 1:</strong> There is an increasing demand for the product.<br />
          <strong>Assumption 2:</strong> The company has already prepared the new product.
        </p>
        <p>Options: A. Assumption 1 is valid B. Assumption 2 is valid C. Both assumptions are valid D. Neither assumption is valid</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. Assumption 1 is valid</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Assumption 1 is valid because the statement mentions increasing demand in the market. Assumption 2 is not explicitly stated or implied in the statement.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Level</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Statement:</strong> "The government has announced a reduction in taxes for the upcoming fiscal year to boost economic growth."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption 1:</strong> The reduction in taxes will lead to economic growth.<br />
          <strong>Assumption 2:</strong> The government is taking steps to improve the economy.
        </p>
        <p>Options: A. Assumption 1 is valid B. Assumption 2 is valid C. Both assumptions are valid D. Neither assumption is valid</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. Both assumptions are valid</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Assumption 1 is valid because the statement directly implies that tax reduction will boost economic growth. Assumption 2 is valid because the reduction in taxes is a step taken by the government to improve the economy.</p>

        <h2>Additional Tips for Solving Statements and Assumptions Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understand the Context:</strong> Analyze the context in which the statement is made. Consider the assumptions that could logically be true based on the context.</li>
          <li><strong>Check for Contradictions:</strong> An assumption that contradicts the statement is always invalid.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Common Sense:</strong> Assumptions should not be too far-fetched or unrealistic. They should be reasonable based on the given statement.</li>
        </ul>
