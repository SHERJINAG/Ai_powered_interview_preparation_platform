  "output": "Question: Two dice are rolled. What is the probability of getting a sum greater than 9? Options: A. 5/36 B. 4/36 C. 3/36 D. 6/36 Answer: A Explanation: The total number of outcomes when two dice are rolled is 36. The possible sums greater than 9 are 10, 11, and 12. The pairs that give these sums are (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (5,6), (6,5), and (6,6), so there are 5 outcomes. Hence, the probability is 5/36."

Options: A. 7/66 B. 5/66 C. 4/66 D. 3/66 Answer: A Explanation: The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 12 is C(12, 2) = 66. The number of ways to choose 2 blue balls from 7 is C(7, 2) = 21. Hence, the probability is 21/66 = 7/66."

Options: A. 10/45 B. 5/45 C. 50/55 D. 40/45 Answer: A Explanation: The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 15 is C(15, 2) = 105. The number of ways to choose one white and one black ball is C(10, 1) * C(5, 1) = 10 * 5 = 50. Hence, the probability is 50/105 = 10/45."

Options: A. 1/6 B. 2/15 C. 1/15 D. 1/5 Answer: B Explanation: The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is C(6, 2) = 15. The number of ways to choose two red balls is C(3, 2) = 3. The number of ways to choose two green balls is C(2, 2) = 1. Hence, the probability is (3 + 1) / 15 = 4/15."

Options: A. 5/55 B. 7/55 C. 10/55 D. 15/55 Answer: D Explanation: The total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 20 is C(20, 3) = 1140. The number of ways to choose one red, one green, and one blue ball is C(5, 1) * C(7, 1) * C(8, 1) = 5 * 7 * 8 = 280. Hence, the probability is 280/1140 = 15/55."
