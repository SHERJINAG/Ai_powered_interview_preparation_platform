      <h1>Cause and Effect - Explanation, Examples, and Strategies</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>What are Cause and Effect?</h2>
        <p>
          **Cause and Effect** is a reasoning concept that explores the relationship between two events. The **cause** is the reason something happens, and the **effect** is the result or outcome of that cause. 
        </p>

        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          - The **cause** is an action, event, or situation that triggers an outcome.
          - The **effect** is the result or consequence of the cause.
          - In reasoning questions, you'll be given a cause, and your task is to determine the correct effect or vice versa.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Solve Cause and Effect Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identify the Cause:</strong> The cause is typically the event or action that triggers a change or consequence.</li>
          <li><strong>Determine the Effect:</strong> The effect is what happens because of the cause.</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate the Relationship:</strong> Carefully analyze if the given cause leads to the effect or if the effect is unrelated or unlikely to follow from the cause.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Causes and Effects</h2>

        <h3>Beginner Level</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Cause:</strong> "The weather was extremely hot."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effect 1:</strong> "People were seen drinking more water."<br />
          <strong>Effect 2:</strong> "The temperature dropped suddenly."
        </p>
        <p>Options: A. Only Effect 1 follows B. Only Effect 2 follows C. Both Effects follow D. Neither Effect follows</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. Only Effect 1 follows</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If the weather is hot, it is reasonable to expect people to drink more water. However, the temperature cannot drop suddenly due to hot weather alone.</p>

        <h3>Intermediate Level</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Cause:</strong> "The traffic signal turned red."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effect 1:</strong> "The vehicles stopped."<br />
          <strong>Effect 2:</strong> "The vehicles started moving faster."
        </p>
        <p>Options: A. Only Effect 1 follows B. Only Effect 2 follows C. Both Effects follow D. Neither Effect follows</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. Only Effect 1 follows</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a traffic signal turns red, vehicles are expected to stop. The second effect, where vehicles move faster, contradicts the nature of the red signal.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Level</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Cause:</strong> "The stock market crashed unexpectedly."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effect 1:</strong> "Many investors suffered significant financial losses."<br />
          <strong>Effect 2:</strong> "The stock market immediately recovered."
        </p>
        <p>Options: A. Only Effect 1 follows B. Only Effect 2 follows C. Both Effects follow D. Neither Effect follows</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. Only Effect 1 follows</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A sudden market crash usually results in significant losses. Immediate recovery is unlikely unless there are other factors at play, making Effect 2 an unlikely outcome.</p>

        <h2>Additional Tips for Solving Cause and Effect Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Look for Natural Connections:</strong> The cause and effect should have a natural or logical relationship. One should clearly lead to the other.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch for Contradictions:</strong> If the effect contradicts the cause, it is not a valid conclusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider External Factors:</strong> In advanced questions, there may be additional factors influencing the effect. Consider all possibilities.</li>
        </ul>
